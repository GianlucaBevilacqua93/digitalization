# Images Digitalization

This source code is useful for those who are dealing with one or more digitalization projects. In particular this code offers the possibility to:
* resize at different levels 
* rename the images according to your own digital content management policy

Moreover you can create associated metadata to the images according to the standard Dublin Core.
